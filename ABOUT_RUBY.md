# About Ruby

Ruby was created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto and its first public release was in 1995.

## The Ideals of Ruby’s Creator

(from [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/))

Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages 
(Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative programming.

He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life.

Building on this, he adds:

> Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body.

## Philosophy

(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)#Philosophy))

Matsumoto has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good user 
interface design. At a Google Tech Talk in 2008 Matsumoto further stated,

> I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. 
> That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.

He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human, rather than computer, needs:

> Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.
